/**
 * The CI supply chain is pinned, and something keeps it current.
 *
 * Two failure modes, and they pull in opposite directions:
 *
 * 1. A MUTABLE TAG is not a version. `actions/checkout@v4` resolves to
 *    whatever the tag points at today, and a tag can be repointed by anyone
 *    who can push to that repo. A compromised or coerced maintainer moves the
 *    tag and every workflow in this repo runs their code, with our secrets,
 *    on the next push. Pinning to a full commit SHA is the only form of this
 *    reference that cannot be changed underneath us.
 *
 * 2. A PIN THAT NOBODY BUMPS rots. shyden.co.uk sat three majors behind on
 *    both of its actions with no mechanism to notice. So the SHA is only half
 *    the control — Dependabot is the other half, and the version comment
 *    beside each SHA is what makes a bump reviewable by a human instead of an
 *    opaque hex swap.
 *
 * SOURCE TEXT, not YAML parsing: no YAML parser is available here and none is
 * worth adding ("no new npm dependencies"), matching pipeline-wiring.test.ts.
