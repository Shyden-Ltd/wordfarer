# M2 #39: Dev on shyden.co.uk Custom Domains, Behind the Dev Password — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Serve Wordfarer's dev web app at `https://dev.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk` and its sync API at `https://dev-api.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk`, with the web app behind the shared Shyden Ltd dev password (HTTP Basic, ported from shyden.co.uk), then retire the `*.workers.dev` addresses and Cloudflare Access.

**Architecture:** A new workspace package, `packages/lockdown`, holds the gate: exact, case-insensitive production-hostname matching, a blocking `robots.txt`, Basic auth with a constant-time compare, and the noindex header. The dev web Worker gains a script that runs before its static assets (`run_worker_first`), so no asset is served without the password; the sync Worker marks non-prod responses noindex and asks for no password (operator decision). Both Workers are attached to their hostnames as Workers Custom Domains in `wrangler.jsonc`, and `scripts/verify-dev.ts` proves the gate live on every `develop` deploy.

**Tech Stack:** Node 24, npm workspaces, TypeScript 6.0, Vitest 4.1, wrangler 4.145 (`createTestHarness`, `unstable_readConfig`), `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.22 (sync Worker only), Cloudflare Workers static assets and Custom Domains, GitHub Actions environments.

**Spec:** issue #39 (story, context, operator decisions, 12 ACs) and its comment of 2026-10-01 13:33 UTC (measurements and the token decision); parent spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-wordfarer-design.md` D9 and §6.7, which Task 4 amends.

## Global Constraints

- Node `>=24`; npm workspaces. Zero warnings: Prettier, ESLint `--max-warnings 0`, `tsc` and `svelte-check --fail-on-warnings`, the build (spec §12).
- **The password value never appears** in the repo, an issue, a PR, a plan, a handover, a log or memory: the repo is public. Shyden types it into the two secret stores himself; the agent's GitHub App has no `secrets` permission (#39).
- The gate is ported from shyden.co.uk `functions/_lib/lockdown.js` and `functions/_middleware.js` at `26b80e2` and names that source. Read access to shyden.co.uk is authorised for this purpose only; never its board, ShyTalk's, or the ShyTalk roadmap.
- The web Worker's gate is tested **through Cloudflare's asset router** (wrangler's `createTestHarness`), never through vitest-pool-workers' `exports.default.fetch` or `SELF`: measured, both call the Worker below the router and stayed green with `run_worker_first: false` (Task 2).
- Tests are written first and seen red against stubs, each test failing on its own; every guard is mutation-verified with its result predicted in writing first.
- No new GitHub Action is added, so every `uses:` stays SHA-pinned as it is; Dependabot already covers npm and `github-actions` (`tests/unit/supply-chain.test.ts`).
- Commit messages and PR bodies say `Refs #39`; never put close/fix/resolve next to an issue number. Commits are authored as Shyden.

## Operator steps (Shyden), and when

The agent cannot do these: its App has no `secrets` permission, and the token belongs to Shyden's Cloudflare login. Each is needed **before PR A merges**, because the merge deploys and verifies at once.

1. **Widen the CI token** (decided 2026-10-01, #39 comment): in the Cloudflare dashboard, open My Profile → API Tokens, edit "wordfarer dev deploy (Workers+D1)", add the permission **Zone · Workers Routes · Edit** with its zone resources limited to **the `shyden.co.uk` zone only**, and save. Editing permissions is expected to keep the token's value (not measured here); if the dashboard shows a new value after saving, put it in the `dev` environment secret `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` as well.
2. **The Worker secret:** in **your own terminal**, not through a `!` command in the agent's session (whatever runs there lands in its transcript), from the repo root (it has no `wrangler.jsonc`, so wrangler takes the Worker from the flag), run `npx wrangler secret put DEV_PASSWORD --name wordfarer-web-dev` and paste the shared dev password at the prompt. Measured 2026-10-01: the secrets API already answers for this Worker (`wrangler secret list --name wordfarer-web-dev` returned `[]`).
3. **The GitHub secret:** repo Settings → Environments → `dev` → Environment secrets → Add environment secret, name `DEV_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`, the same password. Environment-scoped, never repo-level (`tests/unit/workflow-secrets.test.ts` enforces it).

Each one missing at merge fails safe, and differently: without step 1, attaching the Custom Domains needs a permission the token lacks (Cloudflare's documentation; not measured here), so `wrangler deploy` is expected to fail and the `deploy` job to go red; without step 2, the gate answers 401 to everyone (it fails closed) and the verify reports `web: status 401 with the password`; without step 3, the verify stops at `DEV_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD is not set`. In every case `dev-verified` is not posted. Do the missing step and re-run the failed jobs.

## Review Focus

1. **The first deploy before the password is set.** A tester expects a locked site, not an open one. `basicAuthOk` rejects everything when `DEV_PASSWORD` is unset or empty (Task 1, M1.3), and the verify fails rather than passes (Task 4).
2. **A request for a real built file that skips the gate.** Cloudflare serves a matching asset without running a Worker unless `run_worker_first` is set; a tester would expect no game bytes before the password. Task 2 requests a built `/assets/*.js` through the asset router (M2.1), and Task 3's config guard pins the setting (M3.3).
3. **A hostname that looks like production.** `WORDFARER.shyden.co.uk`, `dev.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk`, `wordfarer.shyden.co.uk.evil.com`, `evilwordfarer.shyden.co.uk` and `api.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk` on the web gate: exactly one is production. Task 1 (M1.1, M1.2).
4. **A new Custom Domain's certificate not ready on the first deploy.** A tester expects the pipeline to wait, not fail. The verify makes up to 18 attempts, 10 s apart, retrying every check except a leak, which fails at once (Task 4: the dropped-connection and gate-gone tests, M4.1).
5. **The password in a CI log.** Every verify problem message is checked for the password and its base64 form across leaked, broken and unreachable runs (Task 4, M4.6); GitHub masks the secret as well.

## How this plan was reviewed

A block labelled `(change)` is a unified diff against the previous task's tree, shown for reading: Prettier trims the single space that marks a blank context line, so make the change by hand rather than with `git apply`. A block labelled `(stub)` is the red-step file.

The plan was reviewed by **executing it**. The whole ticket was prototyped in a scratch worktree on `develop` `ac596ce`, then rebuilt as one cumulative commit per task (a stage), each taken file for file from the prototype with `package-lock.json` regenerated, and the last stage asserted identical to the prototype. Each stage was checked out on its own, installed with a clean `npm ci`, and run through every CI step; each task's final tests were run against its stubs; every guard was mutated at its own task's stage, with the result predicted in writing first. Every code block below is generated from those stage commits (`git show <stage>:<path>`) or the stub files, never typed, and checked byte for byte after Prettier.

- **Pass 1 (execution)** (2026-10-01). 13 found and fixed. **Measured facts that changed the design:** (1) a gate test on `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` stayed 6/6 green with `run_worker_first: false`, through `exports.default.fetch` and again through `SELF`: both call the Worker below the asset router. wrangler's `createTestHarness` goes through it; with the setting off it served an unauthenticated built script (200, 22,882 bytes), with it on 401 and 111 bytes. The web gate test is a Node test on the harness, and the web app has no pool dependency; (2) `wrangler`'s `Config` type does not resolve (`TS2307 Cannot find module '@cloudflare/workers-utils'` under `--skipLibCheck false`), so `unstable_readConfig`'s result linted as an error type: the config guard narrows it from `unknown`; (3) the Workers types make `ignoreBOM` required in `TextDecoder` options: passed as its default, `false`; (4) the source compared the password with `===`, matched `Basic` case-sensitively and decoded the credentials as Latin-1: the port compares SHA-256 digests in constant time, follows RFC 7617 on the scheme, and decodes UTF-8, each pinned by a test (M1.5, M1.6, M1.7). **Tests that were wrong:** (5) the web gate test discovered the built script in `beforeAll`, and its red run reported `Tests 10 skipped (10)`: discovery moved into `builtScript()`, and the red run now fails all 10 on their own; (6) the password-leak test covered only judged messages, never the request-failure message built from the request's own inputs (found writing M4.6): it now runs a leaking, a broken and an unreachable site and counts each one's problems. **Tooling:** (7) the stage builder committed the prototype's generated `worker-configuration.d.ts` into Task 1, because `develop`'s `.gitignore` does not list it: the builder deletes it and asserts a clean base; Task 1's mutations had to run with it moved aside for the same reason; (8) `gate.sh` printed only the last `Tests` line, hiding the sync suite behind the web one: it prints every suite; (9) `red.py` read Vite's `✓ built in 94ms` as a test passing at red: excluded; (10) widening the D9 cell made Prettier re-pad the whole decisions table, a 40-line diff for one sentence: the amendment is a note below the table; (11) the unit count rose by one at Task 2 with no new root test file: measured by diffing the sorted test lists, it is `lint-ignores.test.ts` deriving a case from the new `.gitignore` line. **My own predictions:** (12) I wrote M4.7's prediction as 13 passed in the same command that first printed the file's total, 15: corrected to 14 before the run; (13) M4.4 and M4.5 were predicted before finding 6 made the password test count problems, so both caught one test more than predicted (recorded in the Task 4 table, not rewritten). **Mutations:** 26 run at their own stages, all caught, 24 as predicted. **Red runs:** 6, all as predicted (`red-predictions.txt`). **Gates, each stage alone after a clean `npm ci`:** format, lint, typecheck, unit (359, 360, 364, 381, 382), Worker (10 at Task 1; 10 sync and 10 web at Task 2; 14 and 10 from Task 3), build: all pass.
- **Pass 2** (2026-10-01). Mechanical: all 36 generated code blocks equal their stage or stub byte for byte, and the checker reports a planted one-character change (`apx.` for `api.` in Task 1's module: 1 differs, exit 1); every root `npm run` script named exists, and `test` and `types` exist in both Worker workspaces; every name in an Interfaces block is exported; no placeholders. Re-run to check a claim: Task 2's red run prints one shared `Error: not implemented` block under all 10 `FAIL` headers (`[1/10]`). A full read of the prose and tables found 9: (1) operator step 2 said to run `wrangler secret put` through a `!` command, which would put the password prompt through the agent's transcript: it is now Shyden's own terminal; (2) "if any of the three is missing … the gate answers 401" held only for the Worker secret: each missing step's failure is now stated, and the token one is marked as documented rather than measured; (3) a dashboard button label ("Add more") I had not seen: removed; (4) "3 minutes" for the verify's retries: now 18 attempts, 10 s apart; (5) the mutation tables showed file basenames, and M3.4's anchor (`"preview_urls": false,`) occurs in both `wrangler.jsonc` files: the tables show full paths; (6) Task 4's red text allowed a cause the run never reported: narrowed to `Error: not implemented`; (7) Finishing named a Zero Trust menu path I had not checked: it names the objects to delete; (8) a secret scanner refused to read the plan because M3.4's row set `DEV_PASSWORD` to a made-up literal: the mutation now sets it to an empty string, which tests the same name check, and was re-run (1 failed, 3 passed, as predicted); (9) nothing said where the plan is committed: Finishing step 2.
- **Pass 3** (2026-10-01). Mechanical checks re-run after regeneration: 36 blocks equal, Prettier clean. Read: every passage pass 2 changed, as rendered, and the rewritten table rows (full paths, `⏎` breaks). Found 1: operator step 1 asserted that editing a token's permissions keeps its value, which I had not measured; it now says what to do if the value changes.
- **Pass 4** (2026-10-01). Mechanical checks re-run: 36 blocks equal, Prettier clean. Read: a `diff` against the text pass 3 read shows only operator step 1 and pass 3's entry, both read in full; `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is confirmed a `dev` environment secret (`deploy-dev.yml` reads it in a `dev`-environment job, which `workflow-secrets.test.ts` enforces). **No findings: plan approved** under the house rule.

### Task 1: The lockdown module

**Files:**

- Create: `packages/lockdown/package.json`, `packages/lockdown/tsconfig.json`, `packages/lockdown/src/index.ts`
- Test: `packages/lockdown/test/lockdown.test.ts` (the root suite already includes `packages/*/test/**/*.test.ts`)

**Interfaces:**

- Produces, from `@wordfarer/lockdown`: `PROD_HOSTNAME`, `PROD_API_HOSTNAME`, `NO_INDEX`, `REALM`, `BLOCKING_ROBOTS_TXT` (strings); `type Serve = (request: Request) => Promise<Response>`; `isProdHost(hostname: string, prodHostname: string): boolean`; `basicAuthOk(authorization: string | null, expected: string | undefined): Promise<boolean>`; `robotsResponse(): Response`; `challengeResponse(): Response`; `withNoIndex(response: Response): Response`; `gateWebRequest(request: Request, password: string | undefined, serve: Serve): Promise<Response>`; `markApiRequest(request: Request, serve: Serve): Promise<Response>`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the workspace**

`packages/lockdown/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@wordfarer/lockdown",
  "private": true,
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./src/index.ts"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

`packages/lockdown/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  // @wordfarer/lockdown runs in workerd (the dev Workers) and in Node (its
  // unit tests), so it sees only the web platform APIs both share: fetch
  // types, atob, TextEncoder/TextDecoder and crypto.subtle. `types: []` keeps
  // the hoisted @types/node out, so a Node-only API cannot typecheck here.
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2023",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "lib": ["ES2023", "WebWorker"],
    "types": [],
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noEmit": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts"]
}
```

Then `npm install` (no warnings), which links `node_modules/@wordfarer/lockdown`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**

`packages/lockdown/test/lockdown.test.ts`:

// throws and every constant is a value no test accepts.
export const PROD_HOSTNAME = 'stub';
export const PROD_API_HOSTNAME = 'stub';
export const NO_INDEX = 'stub';
export const REALM = 'stub';
export const BLOCKING_ROBOTS_TXT = 'stub';
export type Serve = (request: Request) => Promise<Response>;
const stub = (): never => {
  throw new Error('not implemented');

 * The non-prod lockdown for Wordfarer's Workers (#39).
 *
 * Ported from shyden.co.uk `functions/_lib/lockdown.js` and
 * `functions/_middleware.js` at 26b80e2, which ShyTalk shares. The behaviour
 * is the same: an exact, case-insensitive match on the production hostname
 * passes through untouched; every other host serves a blocking robots.txt
 * publicly and puts everything else behind HTTP Basic auth against one shared
 * password, failing closed when that password is not configured.
 *
 * Three deliberate differences from the source:
 * - the password is compared in constant time (SHA-256 both, then XOR-fold
 *   the digests), using only APIs that workerd and Node share;
 * - the `Basic` scheme is matched case-insensitively (RFC 7617 §2);
 * - the credentials are decoded as UTF-8, as browsers send them, so a
 *   password with non-ASCII characters can match.
 *
 * The sync API is not password-gated (operator decision, 2026-10-01): native
 * apps cannot answer a browser challenge. On non-prod hosts it carries the
 * noindex header and the blocking robots.txt only, as ShyTalk's API does.

- [ ] **Step 5: See them pass**

Run: `npx vitest run packages/lockdown`
Expected: `Tests 35 passed (35)`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/lockdown package-lock.json
git commit -m "feat(lockdown): non-prod gate module, ported from shyden.co.uk (Refs #39)"
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Mutations**

The task is committed first (previous step), so `git checkout -- <file>` returns each mutated file to that commit. For each row: make the change, run `npx vitest run packages/lockdown` unless the row's prediction names another command, compare with the prediction, then `git checkout -- <file>` and confirm `git status --porcelain` is empty. In the Change column, `⏎` marks a line break and `(deleted)` means the line is removed.

- [ ] **Step 8: Gate**

Run, in order: `npm run format:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:worker`, `npm run build`. Expected (measured at this stage after a clean `npm ci`): all pass; unit `Tests 359 passed (359)`, Worker `Tests 10 passed (10)`.

### Task 2: The gated dev web Worker

**Files:**

- Create: `apps/web/worker/index.ts`, `apps/web/worker/tsconfig.json`, `apps/web/vitest.gate.config.ts`, `apps/web/test/gate.test.ts`
- Modify: `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`, `apps/web/package.json`, `apps/web/tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `gateWebRequest`, `NO_INDEX`, `BLOCKING_ROBOTS_TXT` from Task 1.
- Produces: the `wordfarer-web-dev` Worker entry `apps/web/worker/index.ts`, reading the secret `DEV_PASSWORD` and the binding `ASSETS`; the web workspace's `test` script (build, then the gate tests); the root `test:worker` running both Workers' suites.

**Why a harness and not vitest-pool-workers:** the first version of this test used `exports.default.fetch` and then `SELF`; both stayed 6/6 green with `run_worker_first: false`, because they call the Worker's handler below the asset router. `createTestHarness` dispatches through the server, so the router decides whether the Worker runs, exactly as on Cloudflare. Measured with the setting off: an unauthenticated request for the built script got **200 and all 22,882 bytes**; with it on, 401 and 111 bytes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Configure the Worker, its types and the test runner**

- [ ] **Step 3: See them fail against the stub**

`apps/web/worker/index.ts` (stub):

```ts
// Red stub for T2: the Worker exists, and every request throws.
export default {
  fetch(): Promise<Response> {
    throw new Error('not implemented');
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Run: `npm test --workspace @wordfarer/web`
Expected (measured): `Tests 10 failed (10)`, each test on its own (none skipped). Vitest prints one shared error block under all 10 `FAIL` headers: `Error: not implemented`, thrown by the stub Worker. A first version discovered the built script in `beforeAll`; against this stub that reported `Tests 10 skipped (10)`, so discovery moved into `builtScript()`, which each test awaits.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement**

`apps/web/worker/index.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * The dev web Worker: every request passes the non-prod gate (#39) before the
 * static assets are served. `DEV_PASSWORD` is a Worker secret, set by Shyden
 * with `wrangler secret put`; when it is missing the gate fails closed.
 */
import { gateWebRequest } from '@wordfarer/lockdown';

interface GateEnv extends Env {
  /** A secret, so `wrangler types` cannot see it; absent means locked. */
  readonly DEV_PASSWORD?: string;
}

export default {
  fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    return gateWebRequest(request, env.DEV_PASSWORD, (allowed) =>
      env.ASSETS.fetch(allowed),
    );
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<GateEnv>;
```

- [ ] **Step 5: See them pass**

Run: `npm test --workspace @wordfarer/web`
Expected: `Tests 10 passed (10)`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/web vitest.config.ts package.json package-lock.json .gitignore .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "feat(web): gate the dev web Worker before its assets (Refs #39)"
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Mutations**

The task is committed first (previous step), so `git checkout -- <file>` returns each mutated file to that commit. For each row: make the change, run `npm test --workspace @wordfarer/web` unless the row's prediction names another command, compare with the prediction, then `git checkout -- <file>` and confirm `git status --porcelain` is empty. In the Change column, `⏎` marks a line break and `(deleted)` means the line is removed.

M2.1 is the one that matters most: it is the defect the pool-based test could not see. The page-path tests (`/`, `/index.html`, a client route) stay green under it; measured, the router still sent those to the Worker, so only a built asset path tells the setting's absence apart.

- [ ] **Step 8: Gate**

As Task 1. Expected (measured): unit `Tests 360 passed (360)`, Worker `Tests 10 passed (10)` (sync) and `Tests 10 passed (10)` (web). The one new unit test is generated by `lint-ignores.test.ts` from the new `.gitignore` line.

### Task 3: The sync Worker's marking, and the config guard

**Files:**

- Modify: `apps/sync-worker/src/index.ts`, `apps/sync-worker/wrangler.jsonc`, `apps/sync-worker/package.json`
- Test: `apps/sync-worker/test/health.test.ts`, `tests/unit/dev-config.test.ts` (new)

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `markApiRequest` from Task 1.
- Produces: `readDeployConfig(path)` and `wranglerConfigs()` local to `tests/unit/dev-config.test.ts`, which Task 5 extends with `workers_dev`.

`unstable_readConfig` reads a config the way `wrangler deploy` does, so a comment can neither satisfy nor trip these guards. Its return type does not resolve (wrangler bundles `@cloudflare/workers-utils` without its declarations: `tsc --skipLibCheck false` reports `TS2307 Cannot find module '@cloudflare/workers-utils'`), so the test narrows it from `unknown` to a local shape.

- [ ] **Step 2: See them fail**

The "stubs" are `develop`'s own files, before this task:

```ts

const json = (

  Response.json(body, {

async function health(env: Env): Promise<Response> {
  try {
    await env.DB.prepare('SELECT 1').run();
  } catch (error) {
    // The response says only `unreachable`; the cause goes to the Worker logs.

    }
    return health(env);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

`apps/sync-worker/wrangler.jsonc` (stub):

```

Run: `npm test --workspace @wordfarer/sync-worker`
Expected (measured): `Tests 3 failed | 11 passed (14)`. The three are the two `marks … noindex on the dev API host` cases and `serves blocking robots.txt on the dev API host`. `leaves the production API host unmarked, robots.txt included` passes at red by design: `develop` already leaves every host unmarked, and M1.11 guards the prod pass-through.

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/dev-config.test.ts`
Expected (measured): `Tests 1 failed | 3 passed (4)`: `serves the sync Worker at its dev Custom Domain` fails on `expected undefined to deeply equal [ { … } ]`; the web route (Task 2), liveness and vars hold already.

---

### Task 4: Verify through the gate, deploy to the Custom Domains, document

**Files:**

- Modify: `scripts/verify-dev.ts` (rewritten), `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-wordfarer-design.md`, `README.md`
- Test: `tests/unit/verify-dev.test.ts` (rewritten), `tests/unit/workflow-secrets.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**

- Produces, from `scripts/verify-dev.ts`: `interface Probe { status: number; headers: Headers; body: string }`, `interface Target { webUrl; syncUrl; sha; password: string }`, `NO_INDEX`, `basicAuthorization(password)`, `gateProblems(label, probe)`, `leaked(probe)`, `robotsProblems(probe)`, `webProblems(probe, sha)`, `healthProblems(probe, sha)`, `verifyDev(target, { attempts, delayMs }): Promise<string[]>`. It reads `DEV_WEB_URL`, `DEV_SYNC_URL`, `EXPECTED_SHA` and `DEV_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`.

`deploy-dev.yml` stops reading `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` and `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` here, because nothing reads them any more: a secret reference nothing uses is dead config. Access itself stays in front of the `workers.dev` hostnames until Task 5 and the Finishing steps retire both.

 * (#39) still keeps the public out. Each of those is checked here:
 *
 * 1. The web host answers 401 with a Basic challenge and none of the app,
 *    both without credentials and with a wrong password.
 * 2. Its robots.txt blocks every crawler, without credentials.
 * 3. With the password, the page carries `wordfarer-commit` = the expected SHA
 *    and the noindex header.
 * 4. The sync API's /health reports ok, that SHA and db "ok", with the
 *    noindex header (the API is not password-gated, by operator decision).
 *
 * Every check retries, because the previous deploy can be served for a few
 * seconds after an upload and a new Custom Domain's DNS and certificate can
 * take a minute on the first deploy. One thing never retries: a web response
 * that serves content WITHOUT the password. That is a leak, not a delay.
 *
 * The password is sent, never printed: no problem message carries a header.

Dev is `dev.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk` and `dev-api.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk`, Workers Custom Domains on the `shyden.co.uk` zone, declared in each `wrangler.jsonc`. `packages/lockdown` (ported from shyden.co.uk's `functions/_lib/lockdown.js`, which ShyTalk shares) passes the production hostnames through untouched. On any other host the web Worker serves a blocking `robots.txt` publicly and demands HTTP Basic auth against one shared password (`run_worker_first`, so no asset is served without it), failing closed when the password is unset; the sync API is not password-gated, because native apps cannot answer a browser challenge, and carries `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow, noarchive` only. The password lives in two places only, both entered by the operator: the Worker secret `DEV_PASSWORD` on `wordfarer-web-dev`, and the GitHub `dev` environment secret `DEV_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`, which the deploy's verify job reads.

 **Plan note:** server replay needs more CPU than the Workers Free plan's 10 ms per request, so the **Workers Paid plan** (about $5/month) is a launch prerequisite.

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/verify-dev.test.ts tests/unit/workflow-secrets.test.ts` → `Tests 51 passed (51)`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash

The task is committed first (previous step), so `git checkout -- <file>` returns each mutated file to that commit. For each row: make the change, run `npx vitest run tests/unit/verify-dev.test.ts` unless the row's prediction names another command, compare with the prediction, then `git checkout -- <file>` and confirm `git status --porcelain` is empty. In the Change column, `⏎` marks a line break and `(deleted)` means the line is removed.

As Task 1. Expected (measured): unit `Tests 381 passed (381)`, Worker `Tests 14 passed (14)` and `Tests 10 passed (10)`.

PR A is Tasks 1 to 4. Its merge needs the three operator steps above.

### Task 5 (PR B, after PR A is verified live): Custom Domains only

**Files:**

- Modify: `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`, `apps/sync-worker/wrangler.jsonc`
- Test: `tests/unit/dev-config.test.ts`

Start this only once `develop`'s deploy of PR A has posted `dev-verified` (AC8 and AC9 both say "once AC6 is green on `develop`").

       Object.keys(config.vars).map((name) => ({ file, name })),
```

- [ ] **Step 2: See it fail**

The "stubs" are Task 4's configs:

`apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` (stub):

```
// The DEV web app: a Worker with static assets (spec D9, as amended
// 2026-10-01: Cloudflare now folds Pages into Workers), served at
// dev.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk behind the shared dev password (#39).
//
// Cloudflare serves a matching asset WITHOUT invoking a Worker unless
// `run_worker_first` is set, so the gate in worker/index.ts would never see
// the request. Here it is set, and every request pays one invocation; the
// future production config can stay script-less and keep asset requests free.
{
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
  "name": "wordfarer-web-dev",
  "main": "worker/index.ts",
  "compatibility_date": "2026-09-30",
  "workers_dev": true,
  "preview_urls": false,
  "routes": [
    { "pattern": "dev.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk", "custom_domain": true },
  ],
  "assets": {
    "directory": "./dist",
    "binding": "ASSETS",
    "run_worker_first": true,
    // A PWA routes on the client, so an unknown path serves index.html.
    "not_found_handling": "single-page-application",
  },
}
```

`apps/sync-worker/wrangler.jsonc` (stub):

```
// The DEV sync Worker (spec §6.7). Production gets its own config when the
// production pipeline is built; until then this file describes dev only.
{
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
  "name": "wordfarer-sync-dev",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "compatibility_date": "2026-09-30",
  "workers_dev": true,
  "preview_urls": false,
  // The sync API at dev-api.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk (#39). Not password-gated:
  // the Worker marks non-prod responses noindex instead (src/index.ts).
  "routes": [
    { "pattern": "dev-api.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk", "custom_domain": true },
  ],
  "vars": {
    // Overwritten at deploy time with `--var COMMIT:<sha>`, so /health can
    // prove which commit is live. "local" never matches a SHA.
    "COMMIT": "local",
  },
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB",
      "database_name": "wordfarer-dev",
      "database_id": "7ef754ed-f21e-4524-ac11-eac9bde28cc0",
      "migrations_dir": "migrations",
    },
  ],
}
```

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/dev-config.test.ts`
Expected (measured): `Tests 1 failed | 4 passed (5)`: `serves each dev Worker at its Custom Domain only, never on workers.dev` fails on its `toEqual`, both configs reading `true`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

`apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` (change):

```diff

- [ ] **Step 4: See it pass, and commit**

Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/dev-config.test.ts` → `Tests 5 passed (5)`.

```bash
git add apps/web/wrangler.jsonc apps/sync-worker/wrangler.jsonc tests/unit/dev-config.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(deploy): dev Workers serve on their Custom Domains only (Refs #39)"
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Mutations**

The task is committed first (previous step), so `git checkout -- <file>` returns each mutated file to that commit. For each row: make the change, run `npx vitest run tests/unit/dev-config.test.ts` unless the row's prediction names another command, compare with the prediction, then `git checkout -- <file>` and confirm `git status --porcelain` is empty. In the Change column, `⏎` marks a line break and `(deleted)` means the line is removed.

| Id   | File                              | Change                                           | Predicted (written first)                                             | Result       |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| M5.1 | `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`         | `"workers_dev": false,` → `"workers_dev": true,` | 1 failed (serves each dev Worker at its Custom Domain only), 4 passed | as predicted |
| M5.2 | `apps/sync-worker/wrangler.jsonc` | `"workers_dev": false,` → `"workers_dev": true,` | 1 failed (serves each dev Worker at its Custom Domain only), 4 passed | as predicted |

- [ ] **Step 6: Gate**

As Task 1. Expected (measured): unit `Tests 382 passed (382)`, Worker `Tests 14 passed (14)` and `Tests 10 passed (10)`.

## Finishing

**PR A (Tasks 1 to 4):**

1. Re-read the zone for AC1 and quote it in the PR body: `GET /zones?name=shyden.co.uk` → zone name, account id, status (no token printed).
2. Commit this plan to `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-01-m2-39-dev-domains-gate.md` on the branch with Tasks 1 to 4. Push it, open the PR into `develop`, and wait for `build-and-test` green on the PR's head SHA (read the steps by name, match the SHA to `headRefOid`).
3. Confirm the three operator steps are done (ask Shyden; the agent cannot read either secret store).
4. Merge into `develop` (no permission needed). Watch `deploy-dev` on the merge commit: `deploy` attaches both Custom Domains; `verify` must pass and `dev-verified` must appear on the commit.
5. Post the AC evidence on #39: the verify log's success line, `curl -sI https://dev.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk/` (401, `WWW-Authenticate`, `X-Robots-Tag`), `curl -s https://dev.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk/robots.txt`, `curl -sI https://dev-api.wordfarer.shyden.co.uk/health`, and the certificate issuer of each host.

**PR B (Task 5), then the retirements:**

6. Branch from the new `develop`, apply Task 5, PR, CI, merge, and watch `deploy-dev` verify again.
7. AC8 probe: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://wordfarer-web-dev.shyden1988uk.workers.dev/` and the same for `wordfarer-sync-dev`: neither may serve the app or `/health` (record the codes).
8. AC9: delete the Access application `wordfarer-dev` and the service token `wordfarer-dev-ci` in Cloudflare Zero Trust (team `shyden`), and the `dev` environment secrets `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` and `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` (GitHub, Shyden's login). Confirm each by a re-read: the Access application and service token lists, and the environment's secret list.
9. Update `HANDOVER.md` (hostnames, the gate, where each secret lives by name), post the AC evidence comment, and move #39 to Done.
