# M0 Foundations Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build the Wordfarer monorepo toolchain, its CI quality gates, the environment-only secrets guard, a tested sync Worker on D1, and a dev deploy that proves itself live behind Cloudflare Access on every `develop` merge.

**Architecture:** npm workspaces: `apps/web` (Svelte 5 + Vite, served as a Worker with static assets) and `apps/sync-worker` (a Worker on D1). One root CI job runs Prettier, ESLint, `tsc`/`svelte-check`, the root Vitest suite, the Worker suite inside workerd, and the build, and fails on any warning. `deploy-dev.yml` re-runs that job through `workflow_call`. It then applies D1 migrations, deploys both Workers stamped with the commit SHA, and runs `scripts/verify-dev.ts`. The verifier checks from outside that both hostnames refuse anonymous requests, serve this commit, and that D1 answers. Only then does it post a `dev-verified` status.

**Tech Stack:** Node 24, npm 11 workspaces, TypeScript 6.0.3, Svelte 5.57, Vite 8.3, ESLint 10 + typescript-eslint 8.71 (`strictTypeChecked`) + eslint-plugin-svelte 3.23, Prettier 3.9, Vitest 4.1, `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.22, wrangler 4.145, `yaml` 2.9.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-wordfarer-design.md` (§6.1, §6.7, §12.9, §13; D9 as amended in Task 4).

## Global Constraints

- Node `>=24` (`.nvmrc` = 24, `engine-strict=true`). npm workspaces only.
- Zero warnings across lint, `svelte-check`, `tsc` and Prettier (spec §12), and in `npm ci` and `npm run build` output (`scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh`).
- TypeScript stays `~6.0.3` and Vitest `^4.1.11`: typescript-eslint and svelte-check declare `typescript <6.1`, and `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.22 declares `vitest ^4.1`. Dependabot ignores the newer ranges, and the reason is written in `dependabot.yml`.
- Every third-party action is pinned to a 40-hex SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment. Dependabot targets `develop`.
- Deploy secrets are `dev` **environment** secrets only. No job outside `dev`/`production` may reference `secrets.*` other than `GITHUB_TOKEN` (spec §12.9).
- Prettier: `singleQuote: true`, with the Svelte plugin.
- Every Svelte component has `<script lang="ts">` (`svelte/block-lang`). A component without it is compiled as JavaScript and imports as `any` (measured).
- Commit messages and PR bodies say `Refs #N`, never close/fix/resolve next to a number. Commits are authored as Shyden.
- Cloudflare account `9315582c39b627dca58dfa83602db385`, workers.dev subdomain `shyden1988uk`. Dev names: web Worker `wordfarer-web-dev`, sync Worker `wordfarer-sync-dev`, D1 `wordfarer-dev` (id `7ef754ed-f21e-4524-ac11-eac9bde28cc0`, created 2026-10-01 04:38 UTC).

## Review Focus

1. **The Access gate silently disappears** (a toggled-off app, a renamed Worker on a new hostname). A tester expects dev to stay private. `verifyDev` probes both hostnames **without** the token first and fails on a 200 or a redirect anywhere but `*.cloudflareaccess.com` (Task 4, `gateProblems` tests and the "gate is gone" end-to-end test).
2. **The previous deploy is still served** for a few seconds after upload. A "verified" status must mean _this_ commit. The verifier compares the stamped SHA on both hostnames and retries before failing (Task 4, the stale-deploy test with exact retry counts).
3. **A secret reachable by a fork or any branch.** Possible shapes: a secret moved to workflow-level `env`, read with bracket syntax, passed by `secrets: inherit`, used in a job whose environment is computed by an expression, or exposed through a `pull_request_target` trigger. Each is a fixture in Task 2.
4. **The tests run on a different workerd from the one that deploys** after a Dependabot wrangler bump. The test pool pins its own wrangler and miniflare. The lock must hold exactly one wrangler, miniflare and workerd (Task 3, `worker-runtime.test.ts`).
5. **A build or install that warns but exits 0.** The zero-warnings policy needs CI to fail it. `fail-on-warnings.sh` catches CamelCase tokens such as Node's `DeprecationWarning`, reads stderr, and passes a failing command's own status through (Task 1).

## Operator setup (Shyden, before Task 4 merges)

The agent App has no `secrets` or `environments` permission and no Cloudflare Zero Trust scope, so these are Shyden's. Tasks 1–3 do not depend on them.

1. **Cloudflare API token** (dash → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → Custom). Account `Shyden1988uk@gmail.com's Account` only. Permissions: _Account · Workers Scripts · Edit_, _Account · D1 · Edit_, _Account · Account Settings · Read_. Whether this exact set is enough is proven by the first deploy; if wrangler reports a missing permission, add that permission alone.
2. **Cloudflare Access** (Zero Trust → Access → Applications → Add → Self-hosted). One application covering both hostnames `wordfarer-web-dev.shyden1988uk.workers.dev` and `wordfarer-sync-dev.shyden1988uk.workers.dev`. Policy 1: _Allow_ emails `Shyden1988uk@gmail.com` (plus any tester). Policy 2: _Service Auth_ with a new service token `wordfarer-dev-ci` (Access → Service Auth → Create; copy the Client ID and Secret once). If the Worker must exist before Access accepts its hostname, enable Access after Task 4's first deploy. That first verify run then goes red on the gate check, and goes green on a re-run once Access is on.
3. **GitHub `dev` environment secrets** (repo → Settings → Environments → dev → Add secret): `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` = `9315582c39b627dca58dfa83602db385`, `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID`, `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`. Do not create repository-level secrets.

## Board (filed 2026-10-01 05:07 UTC, read back)

Board `PVT_kwDOEOcG584BlRWb` (project 4, title read back as **Wordfarer Stories**). Epics: M0 #5, M1 #6, M2 #17, M3 #7, M4 #8, M5 #9, M6 #10, M7 #11, M8 #12. M0 stories, sub-issues of #5, each carrying its task's AC verbatim: Task 1 → **#13**, Task 2 → **#14**, Task 3 → **#15**, Task 4 → **#16**. All are Todo. Move a story to In Progress when its branch starts, and to Done when its AC evidence is posted.

### Task 1: Monorepo toolchain and CI quality gates

**Story AC:**

1. npm workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`), with `apps/web` a Svelte 5 + Vite shell that renders the wordmark only.
2. Root scripts `format`, `format:check`, `lint` (`--max-warnings 0`), `typecheck` (root `tsc` and every workspace's own), `test:unit`, `build`.
3. ESLint flat config with `strictTypeChecked` and `svelte/block-lang` (`script: 'ts'`). Prettier config with `singleQuote` committed.
4. `scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh` wraps `npm ci` and `npm run build` in CI. A warning or a deprecation on stdout or stderr fails the step, and the command's own exit status passes through.
5. The existing guards are lint-clean under the strict rules. The two unused helpers in `tests/unit/source-text.ts` are deleted.
6. Dependabot ignores `typescript >=6.1.0` and `vitest >=5.0.0`, with the reason beside each.
7. CI runs Format, Lint, Typecheck, Unit tests and Build. The PR is green with no warnings in any step log.

**Files:**

- Create: `.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`, `eslint.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh`, `tests/unit/fail-on-warnings.test.ts`, `apps/web/package.json`, `apps/web/index.html`, `apps/web/svelte.config.js`, `apps/web/vite.config.ts`, `apps/web/tsconfig.json`, `apps/web/src/main.ts`, `apps/web/src/App.svelte`
- Modify: `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (regenerated), `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, `tests/unit/source-text.ts`, `tests/unit/supply-chain.test.ts`, `tests/unit/licences.test.ts`, `README.md`, `HANDOVER.md` (the pending edit), plus this plan file

**Interfaces:**

- Produces: root scripts `format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test:unit`, `build`, which CI calls in that order. Every workspace may add its own `build` and `typecheck`, which the root runs with `--workspaces --if-present`. `scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh <command…>`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Branch.** `git switch -c m0/toolchain origin/develop`. This plan file and the pending `HANDOVER.md` edit are already in the working tree on `develop`, and they move with the switch.

- [ ] **Step 2: Root toolchain.** Write these files exactly. Then run `npm install`, which regenerates `package-lock.json` (npm 11, Node 24). Expect no `npm warn` lines and `found 0 vulnerabilities`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run lint red on the existing guards.** `npm run lint`. Expected: **16 errors**, all in `tests/unit/{licences,source-text,supply-chain}`: 7 `no-unsafe-member-access`, 4 `restrict-template-expressions`, 2 `restrict-plus-operands`, and one each of `no-unsafe-assignment`, `no-unsafe-return` and `no-non-null-assertion`. These are real defects that the stricter rules expose.

- [ ] **Step 5: Fix them.** Replace the three files with these exact versions. `source-text.ts` loses `withoutCommentLines` and `withoutTsComments`: nothing imports either, and `withoutTsComments` is the version without regex-literal and template-substitution lexing. Then `npm run lint` exits 0.

`tests/unit/source-text.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * Comment stripping for the guards that assert against source text. #24.
 *
 * Several suites in this repo read a file as TEXT and assert that something
 * appears in it, or does not. Every one of them is exposed to the same defect,
 * and this repo has now shipped it three times:
 *
 * 1. #23 — `supply-chain.test.ts` asserted `dependabot.yml` contained
 *    `"actions/cache*"`, and the file's own explanatory NOTE spelled that
 *    pattern out verbatim. No group was configured at all; the suite was
 *    green.
 * 2. #21 Stage 4 — `pipeline-wiring.test.ts`'s first dev-sanity check searched
 *    raw text, and pointing the run step at a different config left it green,
 *    because that file's own comment explaining the fix contained the filename
 *    it was looking for.
 * 3. #35 — the pre-push hook guard asserted the hook source contained
 *    `npm run test:unit`. It passed while the hook did NOT run it: the string
 *    survived inside the failure hint the hook prints telling you how to run
 *    it by hand.
 *
 * All three read as obviously correct. None was found by review; each was
 * found by mutation, which is why the standing rule pairs the two: assert on
 * the stripped text, and watch it fail.
 *
 * THE INVERSE IS ALSO A DEFECT and is easier to miss, because nothing goes
 * red. `dead-copy.test.ts` asserts ABSENCE — a key is dead if nothing
 * references it — so a comment naming a key keeps a dead key looking alive and
 * SUPPRESSES a finding rather than satisfying an assertion. Same cause, no
 * symptom.
 */

/**
 * YAML with comments removed, inline ones included, and blank lines dropped.
 *
 * `# vX.Y.Z` beside a pinned action SHA is meaningful data, not prose, so

 * for config bodies where a `#` is always commentary.

 *
 * Quoting in YAML is a STYLE, not a meaning: `'actions/cache*'` and

 * reports a correct config as missing, which is a false ALARM rather than a
 * false pass -- the safe direction, but it reddens CI on config that is right
 * and sends whoever hits it hunting a problem that does not exist.
 *
 * Found by building the org template repository against this repo's own

 * repo's own house style (single quotes, as `'npm'` and `'develop'` are

 *    both of its actions with no mechanism to notice. So the SHA is only half
 *    the control — Dependabot is the other half, and the version comment
 *    beside each SHA is what makes a bump reviewable by a human instead of an

- [ ] **Step 6: Write the failing test for the warnings wrapper.**

`tests/unit/fail-on-warnings.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { spawnSync } from 'node:child_process';

/**
 * scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh, run for real: each case is a shell command
 * whose output the wrapper must judge.
 */
const run = (command: string) =>
  spawnSync('scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh', ['sh', '-c', command], {
    encoding: 'utf8',
  });

describe('fail-on-warnings.sh', () => {
  it.each([
    ['npm warn deprecated x@1'],
    ['(!) Your Vite config uses features that are unsupported'],
    ['WARNING: something'],
    ['found 2 warnings'],
    ['DeprecationWarning: x'],
    ['a deprecation notice'],
  ])('fails a clean exit that printed "%s"', (line) => {
    const result = run(`echo '${line}'`);
    expect(result.status).toBe(1);
    expect(result.stdout).toContain('zero-warnings policy');
  });

  it.each([['all good'], ['swarm of bees']])('passes "%s"', (line) => {
    const result = run(`echo '${line}'`);
    expect(result.status).toBe(0);
    expect(result.stdout).toContain(line);
  });

  it('passes the command’s own failure through, status intact', () => {
    expect(run('exit 3').status).toBe(3);
  });

  it('reads stderr as well as stdout', () => {
    expect(run('echo "npm warn x" >&2').status).toBe(1);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run it red.** Create `scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh` as a stub that exits 0 without running anything (`#!/usr/bin/env bash` then `exit 0`), then `chmod +x scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh`.
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/fail-on-warnings.test.ts`
      Expected: **10 failed**, each on its own assertion. The six warning cases and the stderr case expect status 1 and the stub returns 0; the two clean cases expect their line on stdout and the stub prints nothing; the exit-3 case expects 3.

- [ ] **Step 8: Implement the wrapper.**

`scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs a command and fails if it fails OR prints a warning. A build or install
# that warns still exits 0, so without this the zero-warnings policy (spec §12)
# holds only for the tools that have a --max-warnings flag.
set -uo pipefail

log="$(mktemp)"
trap 'rm -f "$log"' EXIT

"$@" 2>&1 | tee "$log"
status="${PIPESTATUS[0]}"
if [[ "$status" -ne 0 ]]; then
  exit "$status"
fi

# A plain substring match, so CamelCase tokens such as Node's DeprecationWarning
# are caught. It will also flag a word like "forewarned"; that false alarm is
# the safe direction, where a word-boundary match let real warnings through.
pattern='warn|deprecat|\(!\)'
if grep -Eiq "$pattern" "$log"; then
  echo "::error::'$*' printed a warning (zero-warnings policy, spec §12):"
  grep -Ei "$pattern" "$log"
  exit 1
fi
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Run it green.** `npx vitest run tests/unit/fail-on-warnings.test.ts` → 10 passed.

# comment is what makes a Dependabot bump reviewable by a human rather than an
# opaque hex swap -- so never remove it, and never let it drift from the SHA.

      # control, not presence.
      #
      # It is declared here even though a new repo uses no sub-path actions

          - 'actions/cache*'
      patch-updates:
        update-types:
          - 'patch'
```

- [ ] **Step 11: README.** Replace the `## Development` code block with:

```sh
npm ci                # Node 24 (see .nvmrc); engine-strict is on
npm run format:check  # Prettier
npm run lint          # ESLint, zero warnings
npm run typecheck     # tsc and svelte-check
npm run test:unit
npm run build
```

- [ ] **Step 12: Run the whole gate.** In order: `npm run format:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run build`. Expected: each exits 0. Unit: **26 passed** (licences 5, supply-chain 11, fail-on-warnings 10). `svelte-check` reports `0 ERRORS 0 WARNINGS`. Then `scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh npm ci` and `scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh npm run build` both exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 13: Commit.** `ci: workspaces, lint, typecheck, format and zero-warnings gates (Refs #13)`.

- [ ] **Step 14: Mutate (watch each apply; restore with `git checkout -- <file>`).** M12: replace `if grep -Eiq "$pattern" "$log"; then` with `if false; then` → **7 failed / 26**. M13: `<script lang="ts">` → `<script>` in `App.svelte` → `npm run lint` exits 1 on `svelte/block-lang`.

- [ ] **Step 15: PR and merge.** Push, then open a PR into `develop` whose body lists the AC and the gate output. Merge on green `build-and-test`, after reading every step BY NAME on the PR head SHA (matched to `headRefOid`).

### Task 2: Environment-only secrets guard (spec §12.9)

**Story AC:**

1. `tests/unit/workflow-secrets.ts` parses each workflow as YAML, so comments never reach the check. It reports every reference to the secrets context other than `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (`secrets.X`, `secrets['X']`, `toJSON(secrets)`, a `secrets:` key) that sits outside a job whose `environment` is `dev` or `production` (string or `{ name }` form).
2. A secret in workflow-level `env`, or anywhere outside `jobs`, is a finding.
3. A `pull_request_target` trigger is a finding on its own.
4. Fixture tests pin each shape, including a commented-out `environment:` that must not satisfy the guard. A real-repo test scans every workflow, requires each to have jobs, and requires zero findings.

**Files:**

- Create: `tests/unit/workflow-secrets.ts`, `tests/unit/workflow-secrets.test.ts`
- Modify: `package.json` (`yaml` devDependency), `package-lock.json`

**Interfaces:**

- Produces: `scanWorkflow(file: string, source: string): Scan`, where `Scan = { jobs: number; secretReferences: number; findings: Finding[] }` and `Finding = { where: string; problem: string }`. Also `PROTECTED_ENVIRONMENTS = ['dev', 'production'] as const`. Task 4 adds a liveness test that reads `secretReferences`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Branch and dependency.** `git switch -c m0/secrets-guard origin/develop`, then `npm install -D yaml@^2.9.1`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests.**

- [ ] **Step 3: Run red against a stub.** Create `tests/unit/workflow-secrets.ts` exporting the `Finding`/`Scan` types, `PROTECTED_ENVIRONMENTS`, and `export function scanWorkflow(file: string, source: string): Scan { throw new Error('not implemented'); }`.
      Run: `npx vitest run tests/unit/workflow-secrets.test.ts`
      Expected: **14 failed**, each on `not implemented`. If any test passes, that is a finding: stop and fix the test.

### Task 3: Sync Worker on D1, tested inside workerd

**Story AC:**

1. `apps/sync-worker` serves `GET /health`: 200 `{ ok: true, commit, db: 'ok' }` after `SELECT 1` runs on D1. When D1 throws, it serves 503 `{ ok: false, commit, db: 'unreachable' }`. Every response is `cache-control: no-store`.
2. Any other method on `/health` gets 405 with `allow: GET`. Any other path, including `/health/` and `/HEALTH`, gets 404 `{ error: 'not_found' }`.
3. Tests run inside workerd against real local D1 via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, with bindings read from `wrangler.jsonc`.
4. `wrangler.jsonc` binds D1 `wordfarer-dev` (`7ef754ed-f21e-4524-ac11-eac9bde28cc0`) as `DB`, with `COMMIT` defaulting to `"local"` and `migrations_dir` `migrations`.
5. Worker types are generated on install (`postinstall`) and git-ignored, so a wrangler bump never needs a hand-regenerated file.
6. The lock holds exactly one wrangler, one miniflare and one workerd. The test pool's pinned wrangler and miniflare are overridden to the patched ones, and `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities.
7. CI runs the Worker tests.

**Files:**

- Create: `apps/sync-worker/{package.json,wrangler.jsonc,tsconfig.json,vitest.config.ts,src/index.ts,test/health.test.ts,migrations/README.md}`, `tests/unit/worker-runtime.test.ts`
- Modify: `package.json` (wrangler, overrides, `postinstall`, `test:worker`), `package-lock.json`, `.gitignore`, `eslint.config.js`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: the root scripts from Task 1.
- Produces: the default export `{ fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> }`, where `Env = { DB: D1Database; COMMIT: string }` (generated). The deployed `/health` contract that Task 4's `healthProblems` checks is exactly `{"ok":true,"commit":"<sha>","db":"ok"}`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Branch.** `git switch -c m0/sync-worker origin/develop`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Workspace and config.** Write these, then `npm install`. Expected: no warnings, and `found 0 vulnerabilities`. Without the `overrides` block, `npm audit` reports 5 high (sharp, undici) through `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers@0.22.0`'s pinned wrangler 4.124.0 and miniflare 5.20260815.0-alpha. `postinstall` writes `apps/sync-worker/worker-configuration.d.ts`.

      return json({ error: 'method_not_allowed' }, 405, { allow: 'GET' });
    }
    return health(env);

} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run green.** `npm run test:worker` → **9 passed**. Then add the CI step and run the whole gate: unit **43 passed**, worker 9 passed, and every other step exits 0.

M16: insert a lock entry `node_modules/@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/node_modules/miniflare` at version `5.20260815.0-alpha` → 1 failed / 43. Restore after each, then PR and merge.

### Task 4: Dev deploy pipeline, verified live behind Access

**Story AC:**

1. The web build stamps `<meta name="wordfarer-commit">` with `WORDFARER_COMMIT`. A full 40-hex SHA is written. An unset value becomes `local`. Anything else fails the build, and so does a page carrying the placeholder zero times or more than once.
2. `apps/web` deploys as the Worker `wordfarer-web-dev` with static assets (`not_found_handling: single-page-application`). Spec D9, §6.1, §13 and `CLAUDE.md` say so (operator decision 2026-10-01).
3. `deploy-dev.yml` runs on every push to `develop`, in order: CI via `workflow_call`, D1 migrations, the sync Worker (`--var COMMIT:<sha>`), the web build and deploy, and verify. The deploy and verify jobs declare the `dev` environment. Concurrency is `deploy-dev` without cancellation.
4. `ci.yml` drops its own `push: develop` trigger and gains `workflow_call`, so a develop push runs CI once, inside the deploy.
5. `scripts/verify-dev.ts` fails unless all three hold: both hostnames refuse anonymous requests (401/403, or a redirect to `*.cloudflareaccess.com`); with the service token, the page carries this SHA; and `/health` returns exactly `{ok:true, commit: sha, db:'ok'}`. The token checks retry 12 × 10 s and the gate check does not retry. It is tested over real HTTP against a local server that stands in for Access.
6. On success, verify posts a `dev-verified` commit status on the deployed SHA.
7. The secrets guard proves its own liveness by finding the four Cloudflare secrets in `deploy-dev.yml`.
8. After merge, the run is green with every job read BY NAME. `dev-verified` is read off the commit. Both URLs, opened in a browser without logging in, land on the Access login.

**Files:**

- Create: `apps/web/commit-stamp.ts`, `apps/web/commit-stamp.test.ts`, `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`, `scripts/verify-dev.ts`, `tests/unit/verify-dev.test.ts`, `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`
- Modify: `apps/web/{vite.config.ts,index.html,tsconfig.json}`, `tsconfig.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `tests/unit/workflow-secrets.test.ts`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-wordfarer-design.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `scanWorkflow` (Task 2) and the `/health` contract (Task 3).
- Produces: `stampCommit(html: string, commit: string | undefined): string`, `commitStamp(commit: string | undefined): Plugin`, `gateProblems(label: string, probe: Probe): string[]`, `webProblems(probe: Probe, sha: string): string[]`, `healthProblems(probe: Probe, sha: string): string[]`, and `verifyDev(target: Target, { attempts, delayMs }): Promise<string[]>`, where `Probe = { status: number; location: string | null; body: string }` and `Target = { webUrl; syncUrl; sha; clientId; clientSecret }`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Branch.** `git switch -c m0/deploy-dev origin/develop`. Confirm the operator setup is done (ask Shyden). Without it the PR can still merge, but its deploy goes red at the first wrangler call.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests.**

- [ ] **Step 3: Run red against stubs.** Create `apps/web/commit-stamp.ts` and `scripts/verify-dev.ts` with the exported signatures above, each body `throw new Error('not implemented');` (and `export const commitStamp = () => ({ name: 'stub' })`). Add `"scripts/**/*.ts"` to the root `tsconfig.json` `include`.
      Run: `npx vitest run apps/web tests/unit/verify-dev.test.ts`
      Expected: **24 failed** (commit-stamp 8, verify-dev 16), and none passing. `toThrow(/full 40-hex SHA/)` and `toThrow(/exactly once/)` match the message, so the stub's own throw cannot satisfy them.

 * keeps the public out. Each of those is checked here, and the run fails on
 * the first that does not hold:
 *
 * 1. Without a service token, both hostnames refuse (Access redirect or 401/403).
 *    A gate that has quietly gone away fails this, not just a broken site.
 * 2. With the token, the web page carries `wordfarer-commit` = the expected SHA.
 * 3. With the token, the Worker's /health reports ok, that SHA, and db "ok".
 *
 * Checks 2 and 3 retry, because the previous deploy can be served for a few

Dry-run both deploys locally (needs only the local wrangler login). `WORDFARER_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) npm run build --workspace @wordfarer/web`, then `cd apps/web && npx wrangler deploy --dry-run`. Expected: `Read 3 files from the assets directory`. Then `cd apps/sync-worker && npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --var COMMIT:$(git rev-parse HEAD)`. Expected: `env.DB (wordfarer-dev) D1 Database`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Amend D9 and the docs.**
  - Spec §2, D9 row: `**Cloudflare Workers + D1**, matching shyden.co.uk's stack. The web app is a Worker serving static assets (amended 2026-10-01: wrangler 4.145 creates new Pages projects as Workers, and the operator chose Workers static assets over legacy Pages)`.
  - Spec §6.1: `apps/web             Vite PWA shell (Worker static assets)`.
  - Spec §13 Flow: `(web Worker + sync Worker + D1 dev)`. `CLAUDE.md` Flow: the same parenthesis.
  - README Development: `Every merge to develop deploys dev (web and sync Workers, D1) behind Cloudflare Access, and is verified live before it is marked dev-verified.`
  - Then `npx prettier --write` on the three files. Prettier pads Markdown table cells, so find the D9 row by its `| D9` prefix rather than by its padded text.

- [ ] **Step 8: Whole gate.** Unit **68 passed**, worker 9 passed, and format, lint, typecheck and build exit 0. Then `scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh npm ci` and `scripts/fail-on-warnings.sh npm run build` both exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit (`ci: deploy develop to dev and verify it live behind Access (Refs #16)`), then mutate (predict first).** M1 (remove `environment` from the deploy job) → 1 failed / 68. M3 (`name: dev` → `name: staging` on verify) → 1 failed. M5 (`return html;` in `stampCommit`) → 2 failed. M6 (`{40}` → `{7,40}`) → 1 failed. M7 (`gateProblems` accepts 200) → 2 failed. M8 (`/cloudflareaccess\.com/` unanchored) → 1 failed. M9 (no retry) → 1 failed. M14 (a tag-pinned `actions/checkout@v7` in `deploy-dev.yml`) → 2 failed. M15 (`secretReferences` keeps only `secrets.` forms) → 3 failed. The denominator stays 68 in every run.

- [ ] **Step 10: PR, merge, watch the deploy.** Merge on green `build-and-test` (head SHA matched to `headRefOid`). Then poll the `deploy-dev` run on the merge commit until `status == completed`, and read jobs `test / build-and-test`, `deploy` and `verify` BY NAME. Read `dev-verified` off `repos/Shyden-Ltd/wordfarer/commits/<sha>/statuses`. Finally, open both URLs in a browser without a session and confirm the Access login appears. If verify fails only on the gate check because Access could not be enabled until the Worker existed, then once Access is on, re-run that job with `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`, and record it in the story. If the App is refused, ask Shyden to press _Re-run failed jobs_.

## Review log

Every pass ran the checks mechanically: each stage built from `origin/develop` (`d547bd6`) in a scratch worktree, `npm install` with its log read for warnings, the whole gate (format, lint, typecheck, unit, worker, build) with exit codes captured, each task's red step against stubs, and every predicted mutation with its anchor count asserted and the denominator read. The code blocks above are generated from those stage commits, not retyped.

**Prototype findings (before pass 1), all fixed in the code above:**

- `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers@0.22.0` pins wrangler 4.124.0 and miniflare 5.20260815.0-alpha, bringing in 5 high advisories (sharp, undici). Fixed with root `overrides`, and the single-runtime guard added.
- TypeScript 7 and Vitest 5 are newer than typescript-eslint, svelte-check and the Workers pool accept, so the versions are pinned and Dependabot told why.
- A Svelte component with no `<script lang="ts">` imports as `any` under strict TypeScript (bisected: not the TS version, not the path). Now enforced by `svelte/block-lang`.
- Strict lint found 16 defects in the existing guards, plus two unused exports, one of them the comment stripper without regex or template-substitution lexing.
- Vite 8 warns on an extensionless config import while exiting 0, so `fail-on-warnings.sh` was added. Its first two patterns missed `warnings` and `DeprecationWarning`, and it now matches substrings.
- `wrangler pages project create` delegates to Workers and fails without `--force`. Shyden chose Workers static assets (D9 amended in Task 4). The failed attempt created nothing (the account's Workers script list was read back empty).
- A committed `worker-configuration.d.ts` (16,194 lines) would redden every Dependabot wrangler bump, so it is now generated on install and git-ignored.
- The real-repo secrets scan ran in a `describe` body, so a throw would have failed collection. It moved into each test.

**Pass 1 (2026-10-01 04:54–04:58 UTC): 5 findings, all fixed.**

1. `/health` had an untested `db: 'unexpected'` branch for a `SELECT 1` that cannot return anything else. Deleted (dead defensive code), and the AC updated.
2. Task 1 Step 3's expected result contradicted itself (8 of 10 vs all 10). Measured: 10 failed.
3. Task 2's M2 was described, not specified. Now an exact insert, run: 1 failed / 40.
4. Task 4 Step 7 claimed the licences test reads `CLAUDE.md`. It does not, so the claim was removed and the Markdown-table anchoring note added.
5. Task 3 had no mutation for a health check that never queries D1. M17 added and run: 1 failed / 9.

Results after the fixes: stages 26 → 40 → 43 → 68 unit tests and 9 Worker tests, every gate step exit 0, no warning in any install log. All 13 per-stage red steps and mutations matched their predictions, and all 14 mutations on the stage-4 commit `e572643` went red, with the denominator at 68.

**Pass 2 (2026-10-01 04:59–05:01 UTC): 2 findings, both fixed.**

1. The generated plan failed `prettier --check`, so committing it would have reddened CI on the very ticket that adds the check.
2. Prettier's default `embeddedLanguageFormatting` rewrote the quoted code (it collapsed `package.json`'s `workspaces` array), so the plan no longer matched the files it quotes. `.prettierrc.json` now sets `embeddedLanguageFormatting: "off"` for `*.md`, which leaves quoted code verbatim and still formats the prose. The stages were rebuilt and re-gated (26 / 40 / 43 + 9 / 68 + 9, every step exit 0, no install warnings). The mutation and red runs were not repeated, because a formatter option for Markdown changes no file they read.

Also checked in pass 2 and clean: every file changed in each stage is quoted in that stage or produced by a stated command (`npm install -D yaml@^2.9.1` reproduced stage 2's `package.json` byte for byte). Every quoted file changed in its stage. Every `npm run` target exists in its workspace. Every interface name in the Interfaces blocks is defined in the quoted code. The Task 1/3/4 README edits, applied together, pass `prettier --check`.

**Pass 3 (2026-10-01 05:01–05:03 UTC), a full read of every step and AC against the spec: 4 findings, all fixed.**

1. Task 1 ran the wrapper's tests (Steps 2–5) before installing the toolchain (Step 6), so they would have run on `develop`'s Vitest 5. The steps are reordered: toolchain, web shell, lint red, fix, then the wrapper red and green.
2. Task 1's Interfaces listed the CI steps out of order. They now read format, lint, typecheck, unit, build, as `ci.yml` runs them.
3. Task 1 said to copy the plan into the branch. It is already in the working tree and moves with `git switch`, as does the pending `HANDOVER.md` edit.
4. Task 4's fallback ("re-run verify") named no route. It now says `gh run rerun --failed`, or Shyden's button if the App is refused.

Measured to settle two expectations: stage 1's lint against the unfixed guards gives **16 errors** (by rule: 7 / 4 / 2 / 1 / 1 / 1). A first count of 17 came from a git-ignored `worker-configuration.d.ts` left on disk by a later stage, which is not a defect in stage 1. And `postinstall`'s `wrangler types` succeeds before `src/index.ts` exists, so Task 3's Step 2 install works as ordered.

**Pass 4 (2026-10-01 05:02–05:03 UTC): 0 findings.** All 47 quoted blocks matched their stage files byte for byte after Prettier. Step numbers ran in sequence in every task (15 / 6 / 7 / 10). Stage-file coverage held with the expected exceptions (regenerated locks, the `HANDOVER.md` edit, and stage 2's `package.json` from `npm install -D yaml`). There were no placeholders apart from the four story references, which were open by design until filing. The reordered Task 1 and the changed Task 4 step were re-read.

**Pass 5 (2026-10-01 05:07–05:08 UTC), after the board was filed: 0 findings.** The four story references were resolved to #13–#16, and the Board section records the filed items. Re-ran on that edit: no story placeholder remains (a first grep matched this very sentence, which then spelled the placeholder out; reworded so the check measures the plan, not its own log), each task's `Refs` names its own story, all 47 blocks still match their stage files, and Prettier is clean. **The plan is approved** under the operator's standing rule (reviewed to zero, then self-approved).
