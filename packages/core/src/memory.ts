/**
 * Memory (parent spec §3.3, §3.4; M1 design §2.2 item 4).
 *
 * FSRS-6 retrievability t days after a review, at stability S days, is
 * R(t) = (1 + F t / S)^(-d), where d is the scheduler's decay w[20] and
 * F = 0.9^(-1/d) - 1 puts R at 90% when t = S. Production needs each word's
 * mean R over an hour bucket, so this module also gives that mean in closed
 * form. Everything goes through det-math, so the bits match on every engine.
 *
 * Reviews are scheduled by ts-fsrs with FSRS-6's default weights and fuzz
 * off, so the same answers give the same schedule everywhere: a correct
 * answer is rated Good and a wrong one Again. A word's rank follows its
 * stability but moves only on an answer: up (possibly several steps) on a
 * correct one, exactly one step down on a wrong one, and never through
 * absence (DN16).
